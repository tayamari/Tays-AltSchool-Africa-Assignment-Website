    <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Tay Little. I'm a student of frontend engineering and UX design. I love coding, learning about it is fascinating to me. I aspire to create amazing and useful designs that are accessible to people and improve the world.

        </p>
    <h2>
        Why did I join AltSchool?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I joined AltSchool Africa because I was drawn in by the prioritization of Africans joining tech.
        Because of disenfranchisement, career-wise, the tech world is overwhelmingly white, cis, and male-dominated. I believe it's important for me to follow my passions in this field, and AltSchool seemed like a possible way of helping to achieve that.
    </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal in the School of Engineering program is to build confidence with my use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other languages we get exposed to.
